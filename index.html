      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img id="Profile-Picture" src="assets/images/ProfilePicture.png" alt="A picture of Alex Reinking">
        <p>I am 23 years old and have lived in Austin my entire life.  I went to Austin High School and then studied Petroleum Engineering at the University of Texas.  After graduating in August, 2015, I worked on an oil rig for six months, which was quite the experience.  I hope to go back to the oil and gas industry after I complete the UT Coding Boot Camp.  It would be cool to take what I learn from this course and apply it to that industry.  I am currently working for Reed Insurance Agency and taking classes at night and on the weekends. </p>
        <p>I grew up as the youngest of four children, with two older brothers and an oldest sister.  We loved sports and competing throughout our childhood.  Basketball became our favorite sport and both of my brothers played in college, but I chose to focus on my education.  My family is rapidly growing as I have a niece and three nephews and many more on the way, soon.  When I am not working or coding, I enjoy hanging out with friends and family, whether it be playing sports, playing video games, going out to eat, or just hanging out.</p>
